# 🏭 XYZ Manufacturing – ICS Cyber Intrusion Response Plan

## 🚨 1. Overview
XYZ Manufacturing detected a **cyber intrusion** in its **Industrial Control System (ICS) network**.  
Attackers, suspected to be **state-sponsored**, aimed to **disrupt production lines** and cause significant financial loss.

### 🔹 Key Actions Taken:
- Isolated affected ICS systems & contained the intrusion.
- Engaged **cybersecurity experts & forensic analysts**.
- Investigated **attack vectors & Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**.
- Restored system integrity & reinforced security defenses.

---

## 🔍 2. Incident Identification & Analysis
### **How It Was Detected**
- **Unauthorized access logs** in ICS systems.
- **Unusual network activity** linked to external IPs.
- **Production line fluctuations & unexpected shutdowns**.

### **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**
- **Unauthorized privilege escalation attempts**.
- **Malicious firmware changes in ICS devices**.
- **Presence of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) indicators**.

---

## 🛑 3. Incident Response Actions
### **Containment**
- **Disconnected compromised ICS segments** from the main network.
- **Blocked malicious IP addresses & revoked compromised credentials**.
- **Implemented emergency access controls to prevent further damage**.

### **Eradication**
- Conducted **forensic analysis** to identify the attack origin.
- Removed **malware, backdoors, and unauthorized system modifications**.
- Applied **security patches** and firmware updates.

### **Recovery**
- Restored ICS systems from **clean, verified backups**.
- Validated **data integrity & manufacturing process stability**.
- Strengthened **disaster recovery protocols**.
